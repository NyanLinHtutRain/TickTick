# Todoey - Task Management App

## Project Proposal

### Overview
`Todoey` is a simple yet powerful task management application designed to help users organize their daily activities efficiently. Developed as an iOS app using Swift and Xcode, Todoey offers an intuitive user interface and robust functionality, including task creation, categorization, prioritization, and reminders. Leveraging the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and Core Data for persistent storage, Todoey aims to provide a seamless experience for students, professionals, and anyone seeking a lightweight, reliable tool to stay organized.

This project, initiated by Nyan Lin Htut and Kyaw Zaww Linn, follows an agile SCRUM methodology with three development iterations, focusing on core features, advanced enhancements, and performance optimization. Contributions from the open-source community are encouraged to further enhance its capabilities.

### Objectives
- **Streamline Task Management**: Deliver a user-friendly app for creating, managing, and completing tasks with ease.
- **Enhance Usability**: Provide a clean, intuitive interface with features like categorization, prioritization, and reminders.
- **Ensure Reliability**: Implement persistent storage with Core Data and maintain high code quality through testing.
- **Foster Collaboration**: Build an open-source foundation for community-driven improvements and integrations.

### Target Audience
- **Todoey Users**: Individuals or teams needing a simple, effective tool to manage daily tasks.
- **Developers**: Contributors interested in enhancing an open-source iOS app or integrating it with other tools.
- **Productivity Enthusiasts**: Users seeking a lightweight alternative to feature-heavy task management apps.
