## Project Description  
The Todoey app is a task management application designed to help users efficiently organize their daily tasks and activities. The app allows users to create, manage, and prioritize their to-dos by categorizing them into customizable lists. Essential functions include adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed, with advanced features such as prioritization, reminders, and task reordering. The Todoey app is designed for anyone who needs an organized approach to task management, from students to professionals.  

---

## Justification for the Project  
Managing tasks effectively is essential in today’s fast-paced world. The Todoey app addresses the need for an intuitive and reliable tool to keep track of daily activities. Unlike generic task management apps, Todoey focuses on simple, user-friendly navigation combined with powerful features like prioritization and reminders.  

---

## Problem Statement  
Many users struggle to manage their tasks efficiently due to the lack of organized and categorized task lists. Additionally, existing apps often overwhelm users with unnecessary features or a cluttered interface. The Todoey app aims to provide a balanced solution, offering essential task management features while maintaining a clean, intuitive design.  

---

## Market Research  
The productivity app market is saturated with numerous task management tools. However, feedback from users indicates a need for a lightweight, efficient, and easy-to-use application with core functionalities and minimal distractions. Todoey aims to fill this gap by focusing on streamlined task management.  

---

## ICT Technology Research  
The Todoey app is developed using Swift and Xcode, taking advantage of the robust Apple development ecosystem. The app uses Core Data for persistent storage, allowing users to save tasks and categories locally. GitHub is used for version control, and the project follows an agile development process to ensure flexibility and continuous improvement.  

---

## Available ICT Solutions  
Existing task management applications include Todoist, Microsoft To-Do, and Any.do. While these apps offer a wide range of features, they are often too complex for users who need a simple, efficient tool for daily task tracking. Todoey addresses this by offering core functionalities with a focus on usability.

## Available Days Calculation  

To effectively plan our project timeline, we calculated the available hours for each team member over the project duration. We considered individual availability per week and used a focus factor to estimate the velocity for each sprint.

Available Hours
The team consists of two members: Nyan Lin Htut and Kyaw Zaww Linn. Each member's available hours per week were calculated based on their workload and commitment to the project:

Nyan Lin Htut: Varies from 5 to 9 hours per week.
Kyaw Zaww Linn: Varies from 5 to 8 hours per week.
Total available hours: Ranges from 10 to 14 hours per week.
Focus Factor
We used a focus factor to account for productivity variations during each sprint. The focus factor was calculated based on team efficiency and task complexity:

The focus factor fluctuated between 17% and 133% throughout the project timeline.
Estimated Velocity
By multiplying the available hours by the focus factor, we derived the estimated velocity for each sprint. The estimated velocity varied significantly, reflecting the team's variable productivity in different weeks.

This calculation allowed us to plan our iterations effectively, ensuring that our workload was manageable and realistic for each sprint.
